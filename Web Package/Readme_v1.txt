Instructions to update the web application
-------------------------------------------

1. Copy the bin.zip file from https://github.com/saitheodore/rxpl/tree/master/Web%20Package
2. Unzip and overwrite the contents of the zip file to the location where the web application is installed.
3. Note: this zip file just contains the binary files (dll/pdb) and it does not have the html/images etc. The updates are just for the binary files.
